# fCavEX

[Cave Explorer](https://github.com/xtreme8000/CavEX) by [xtreme8000](https://github.com/xtreme8000) is a Wii homebrew game with the goal to recreate most of the core survival aspects up until Beta 1.7.3. ~~Any features beyond *will not* be added.~~

*fCavEX* (forked CavEX) is an experimental fork of CavEX, made by [yyy257](https://github.com/yyy257), with all kinds of changes and additions. Some additions may not be from the original game and some mechanics may be different - this fork is not aiming for a 1:1 recreation. Unlike CavEX, fCavEX does not aim for complete save compatibility - for instance, chests and signs use an incompatible saving system with static limits and some blocks may use metadata values differently. Until stated otherwise, a freshly created save should be compatible, as fCavEX does not have its own world generator yet.

I took yyy257's fork and decided to continue the work he's done, and add more features. All is still highly experimental.

**Changes, compared to yyy257's fCavEX**

* Redstone functionality: redstone torches, wires, pressure plates can power doors and trapdoors. It's an early version and wire placement doesn't look good yet. Pistons and repeaters are planned to be added as well.
* Farming crops: dirt to farmland with a hoe, planting seeds to let crops grow
* Growing mushrooms: mushrooms spread when they're in the dark.
* Fire: You can set stuff on fire with your flint&steel, fire can spread to flammable objects.
* Bed: Using a bed progresses time. Still a work in progress but the basics are there
* Stars at night, to make it easier to orient during total darkness at night.
* Particle effects for torches. Just looks a bit better. (uses particles.png)
* TNT can now explode.

**Planned features** *(in no particular order, not complete)*
* Sounds
* Block gravity: sand and gravel drop down when there's nothing underneath them to support
* Water/lava flow: once a brick has been removed next to, or underneath a liquid, it will flow there
* Additional controller support
* Mobs
* Minecarts
* Fixes to existing bugs:
	- Furnace has 4 identical sides
 	- leaves stay floatingin the air after log has been removed

There should then be a .dol file in the root directory that your Wii can run. To copy the game to your `apps/` folder, it needs to look like this:
